          <!-- <p> My name is Banji Oyewole, and I desire to understand, create and explore.</p> -->

          <p>While at university, I led a rebranding effort for our student government in addition to my studies.

          <!-- <p>For instance, I was the Director of Marketing and Outreach for our student government. During my tenure, I rebuilt its brand identity, introducting a newly designed logo and approaching marketing in refreshing ways to increase student engagement.</p> -->

          I also built software from the ground up that valued user experience as an equal to overall function.
          <!-- <p>I've also worked with like-minded thinkers to create a not just the software, but a company whose focus was to build beautiful, functional apps that would have a meaningful impact on the way people found new experiences at University.</p> -->

          And I've also had the pleasure of being a part of telling stories in the theater department and telling stories of my own through cinema.

          <!-- <p>I wrote a short film called "Voux &amp; I." With an incredible team of 6 I spent 10 days of school shooting, and editing the movie, which took an award at our stuent film festival.</p> -->

          Projects like these were incredible to work on. This website surfaces some projects that I've worked on that I like the most.</p>
