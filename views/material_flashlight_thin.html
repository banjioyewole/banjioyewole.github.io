          <p>Imagine an application whose design intent was to delight. The flashlight back in 2013 was a staple. I came to the market with Flashlight X because the apps that existed were purely functional, which left an unticked box in all other cases: Form. Flashlight X’s approach to user experience was unique in that it wasn’t an attempt to digitally reproduce a physical flashlight; It was a reimagination of the flashlight in a purely digital space. </p>
          <p>I arrived at an app with a single button occupying the whole screen, and a Floating Action Button to access other features like strobe, sound reaction and, most recently, camera preview. What sets Material Flashlight apart is not only its gorgeous execution, but its slew of advanced features that are not only easy to use, but look great too.</p>
