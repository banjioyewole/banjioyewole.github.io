  <p>My name is Banji Oyewole. I’ve looked at the world a little differently for as long as I can remember. The first mobile app I made all came from me seeing something that was functional, but a half step in terms of user experience. By putting users first, we're able to create some incredible experiences. The question I ask every time I make anything is what will someone get from this the first time they look at it. I ask that question about everything from academic papers, to the mobile applications I’ve designed and developed. This site shows off some things I believe came to be from that single question.</p>

          <p> The Myngo Project was my summer in 2016. It was our answer to the question "How would we do food delivery for us?". We were college students who wanted food delivery for our campus. Tacoma hadn't been addressed by any of the big names of food delivery at the time, so we sat down, and designed and developed our own food delivery service.</p>
          <p> Not only were we college students, but we were also designers, developers, and business people. At the end of the year, four of us got together and created the brand and the company that would become Honeyfire, LLC and Myngo. We brought in great libraries from Firebase for our push notifications for the driver mobile applications, and Paypal's Braintree to support in app billing with payment cards.</p>
          <p> My job was product design, and android design and development. In Fall of my Junior year, we ran Myngo Beta, and completed over 50 orders, and collected valuable data that would shape the product going forward. Myngo was an application built by designers that placed user experience before everythign else, which resulted in an incredible food delivery experience from discovering local restaurants, all the way though checking out and checking your order status.</p>

            <p> The HD Project was one of the first things I ever did as a burgeoning developer and designer. It started as a place to share pictures I'd taken and let me to be quickly change my phone wallpaper using pictures I'd taken.</p>
            <p>The first iteration looked more like classic instagram with squeomorphic corkboards and textures galore. As I grew as a software developer and a designer I continued to update the application moving images from being embedded in the app to being hosted on this very server.</p>
            <p>My most recent update continues to provide access to my favorite pictures and makes it easier than ever to add new content from anywhere. Though a classic idea, its current iteration is a standout in its easy to use, minimalistic, and content centric implementation.</p>
